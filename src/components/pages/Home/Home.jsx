             <div className="pha"><p>Playing video games is a popular activity people do in their free time. However, 
                 video games can have major effects on health. People debate whether these effects are good or bad. Video 
                 games can improve children’s learning, health, and social skills.
Both children and adults enjoy playing video games. There’s research that shows there’s a benefit to playing video games. 
There’s also research that implies video games could lead to disrupted sleep, media addiction, and violent behavior.
If your child is showing concerning behavior, you may need to step in. These may include irritability when not playing their 
game or they’re showing increasing aggression. Even if this behavior occurs, there are steps you can take to regulate violent 
media intake. We hope to help you.

<h3 className="hed">How Safe Are Video Games?
</h3>
<p>Video gamers, parents, politicians and the press often lionize or attack video games, which opens 
    the door to spin that obfuscates our understanding of how these games affect people. For example, the European 
    Parliament has been debating whether to limit children’s access to video games. In a press statement about the report that 
    resulted from its deliberations, the parliament concluded that games could have “harmful effects on the minds of children.” 
    Reporting on this statement, however, the headline in the Guardian read, “Video games are good for children.”


</p>

  <p>
  Video games are relatively safe for your child to play. Despite previous research suggesting the dangers of video games, 
    there are ways to protect your child. You can prevent potential harm from a video game by monitoring and limiting what 
    they’re playing. Talk to your child about staying safe online. 
Building a trusting relationship will make your child want to talk to you. They’ll be more inclined to let you know how they 
are feeling about life. This can help you notice if they are struggling and need help. There are three parts to consider before 
you worry about your child and violent video games: their personality, the situation they're in, and their motivation behind playing 
video games. These play a part in how they react to violence on screen.</p>
<p>However, Psychologists and neuroscientists conducting well-designed studies are beginning to shed light on the actual effects of video games. These studies show a clear trend: Games have many consequences in the brain,
     and most are not obvious—they happen at a level that overt behaviors do not immediately reflect. Because the effects are subtle,
      many people think video games are simply benign entertainment.

Research projects of variable strength have substantiated claims of both beneficial and harmful effects. Too often the discussion ends 
there in a “good” versus “evil” battle, reminiscent of the plots of the violent video games themselves.</p>
<h3 className="hed">Benefits of Playing Video Games</h3>
<p>Video games are good for helping children develop problem-solving skills. They aren’t lazy as previous research has suggested. 
Video games can strengthen your child’s cognitive skills. They can improve your child’s capacity to think in
 three-dimensional ways. </p>
 <h3 className="hed">Ethical Issues of Video Games for Kids</h3>
 <img className="imgg" src="https://www.parhlo.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/video-game-addiction.jpg.webp"/>
 <p>According to Dang et al. (2007) new video games are ethically affecting people who play them. 
     Additionally, the ethical issues include: violence, rating, education, stereotyping against women, 
     community and addiction. computer games can be a great recreational hobby. However, video game addiction can lead 
     to several issues. The negative effects
      of Computer games include effects on our mind, 
     body relationships, job performance, and more.

It is important to remember that Cumputer games are not inherently evil. Most of the negative effects of Cumputer games arise from 
excessive use and addiction. Here are ten negative effects of Computer games</p>
<h5 className="subhed">01. Dopamine Addiction</h5>
<img className="imgg" src="https://assets.website-files.com/60807ca2d01082168c9aac03/60a9d93df4bfe1629fde9391_Brain-Dopamine-Addiction-1024x576.jpeg"/>
<p>The reward circuitry in your brain is one of the reasons video games are fun. Your brain releases a neurotransmitter 
    called dopamine, which regulates the feeling of pleasure from video games. When dopamine activity happens in the nucleus accumbens, 
    the pleasure center of your brains, you feel joy.

When you play video games, your brain releases a constant dopamine supply, with occasional random bursts. Over time, your brain gets 
used to this steady supply of dopamine, and the nucleus accumbens requires even more dopamine release for gaming to feel fun. That 
prevents you from enjoying anything that is not as stimulating as a video game.

Even if you try to give up gaming, your mind will attract you to other forms of stimulation, such as browsing YouTube or scrolling 
through social media. Simple activities will seem completely unappealing, and you will not be motivated to do anything that isn’t 
exciting. That is the height of dopamine addiction. If you let your gaming habit get out of control, this is a real possibility.</p>



<h5 className="subhed">Negative Effects of Computer Games on Motivation</h5>
<img className="imgg" src="https://images.saymedia-content.com/.image/t_share/MTc0NDYyMjk1ODAyMzg5ODY0/the-dark-side-of-social-media.jpg"/>
<p>Unlike the nucleus accumbens, we cannot map the triumph circuit onto the brain as easily. It does not localize to one part of the brain — it’s just a general pattern of psychology and cognition integral to human beings.

The triumph circuit makes us feel good when we overcome a challenge. In evolutionary biology, there’s a strong story about 
venturing into the unknown, finding something valuable, overcoming some kind of problem, and then bringing it back to society.
 That has shaped social psychology — we as human beings value people who overcome odds.

Video games have hacked this circuit. They have found a way to deliver all the psychological rewards that we often seek to gain 
from the real world. What we want from video games is often very similar to what we want from life. We want excitement, adventures, 
friendships, victories, and status. Games have found a way to serve that to us with little effort on our end. As a result, a person’s 
ability to engage the triumph circuit 
suffers when they can just engage it with video games.</p>



<h5 className="subhed">Emotions</h5>
<img className="imgx" src="https://www.claremontportside.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/images4545-5f6cb35393213.jpg"/>
<p>When we experience fear, worry, shame, or other negative emotions, the amygdala becomes active. The amygdala is the part of that 
    brain that governs these negative emotions. It is also integral to our learning circuitry since it creates connections to the 
    hippocampus, the center for learning in our brain.

However, fMRI studies have shown that if we start to play video games when our amygdala is active, it calms down. The effects of 
this are two-fold:

Constant suppression of negative emotions can lead to a condition called alexithymia. If a person is alexithymic, then that means that 
they have trouble determining their internal emotional state. Alexithymic people find it hard to pinpoint the emotions that they are 
feeling. However, that does not mean that those emotions do not affect their behavior.
The amygdala is a core part of our learning circuitry. Painful experiences get imprinted onto our memory, and we learn from them. 
However, people find it hard to quit playing video games because their amygdala does not make connections with their hippocampus as 
smoothly. They don’t learn from the painful experiences of not doing well in school or at work. Their learning circuitry gets sabotaged, 
and it becomes difficult 
for them to quit gaming.</p>

<h5 className="subhed">Health Effects</h5>
<img className="im" src="https://www.daimanuel.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/isolation-from-reality-gaming-addiction.png"/>
<p>Playing video games is not an unhealthy activity on its own. However, if done for hours on end, it can quickly become detrimental 
    to one’s physical health. 
    Here are some health issues that can arise due to video game addiction.</p>
    <h6>Repetitive Stress Injuries</h6>
    <p>Repetitive Stress Injuries (RSIs) are relatively common among gamers. Gaming requires strenuous, 
        repetitive motion on the hands and wrists (sometimes for hours on end). These motions can cause inflammation and 
        injury. Here are some RSIs that you can develop from gaming:

Gamer’s thumb is a nickname given to a condition called de Quervain’s Tenosynovitis. It is a condition in which the tendons that move
 our thumb become inflamed, which leads to pain and limited movement.
Trigger finger, also known as Stenosing Tenosynovitis, is a condition in which a finger gets stuck in a bent position. It may bend or 
straighten with a snap, like a trigger being pulled or released, hence the name.
Tennis elbow (Lateral Epicondylitis) is also a potential RSI that you can develop by gaming too much. It is a painful condition in
 which the tendons in the elbow get overloaded, usually due to repetitive movement of the wrist and arms.
Carpal Tunnel Syndrome is another RSI that can be caused by gaming too much. Its characteristic symptoms are numbness, tingling,
 or weakness in the hand. It occurs due to pressure on the median nerve. This nerve runs from your forearm into your hand through a
  part of your wrist called the carpal tunnel.</p>

<h5 className="subhed">Other Physical Health Issues</h5>
<img className="imgg" src="https://osu-wams-blogs-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/blogs.dir/2098/files/2019/08/physical-health-problem-header-690px.jpg"/>
<p>We all know the feeling of getting lost for hours in a game, often forgetting to eat, or snacking on unhealthy foods. It should not be a surprise then, that obesity and malnutrition are risk factors from gaming too much. There is also some preliminary evidence that excessively playing video games can lead to obesity in teens.
Eyestrain is a pervasive issue among gamers. Staring at a screen for hours on end. The eyes focus much differently on a video screen 
than any other flat surface, such as a notebook. It is less strenuous to stare at a notebook because the distance is constant, and the 
eyes know where to focus. However, on a video screen, the focus is continually changing, leading to eye fatigue. It becomes difficult 
for the eyes to focus on other objects, even after 
the gaming session is over.
A study done on Australian adolescents found that prolonged periods of sitting at a computer could alter their developing 
neuromusculoskeletal system. Posture problems are incredibly common among gamers. The body tries to obtain the least energy-demanding 
position when it finds itself in one spot for prolonged periods. As a result, rounded shoulders, head leaned forward, a curved lower 
back, and back and neck problems later in life are common among gamers.</p>

<h5 className="subhed">Affect the Brain Negatively</h5>
<img className="i" src="https://assets.website-files.com/60807ca2d01082168c9aac03/60a9d93df18a35901e0e7308_Depression-1024x683.jpeg"/>
<p>Video games do not necessarily lead to mental health problems. However, you can be at high risk for video game addiction if you 
    already suffer from depression, anxiety, or other mental illness. This is due to the way video games affect your brain.

A study that looked at the effect of gaming on mental health found that problematic gaming habits correlated with maladaptive coping 
strategies, negative emotions, low self-esteem, a preference for solitude, and poor school performance.

While one of the benefits of gaming is an increase in the ability to concentrate, excessive gaming may lead to the opposite. A study 
done on 3000 children and adolescents from 12 different schools in Singapore found a bidirectional causality in play between video 
games and attention deficit disorders. While excessive gaming could contribute to a lack of long-term concentration ability, it is 
also likely that children who already
 show signs of attention deficit disorders would be more attracted to video games, due to the variety of experiences they can provide.</p>

<h5 className="subhed">Relationship Issues</h5>
<img className="i" src="https://assets.website-files.com/60807ca2d01082168c9aac03/60a9d93df39184aec9bbacf1_Family-1024x683.jpeg"/>
<p>Relationship issues resulting from playing too many video games is a common issue among gamers and their families. When people get 
    too addicted to video games, they start to neglect other parts of their lives. The first parts to go are wholesome and 
    supportive relationships with family, friends, and loved ones.

Relationships need work to maintain. They are like a plant — if you neglect one long enough, it will wither up and die. Relationships 
need to regular nurturing for them to grow or even maintain. However, when a person spends most of their time playing video games, 
there is almost no time left in the day to talk to friends and family, let alone pursue romantic relationships.

A healthy amount of gaming with friends and family can lead to stronger bonds. However, excessive gaming often results in isolation. 
Therefore, it is much more important to keep an eye on your relationships and see if they are moving down a path that you do not desire.</p>

<h5 className="subhed">Social Disconnection</h5>
<img className="imgg" src="https://assets.website-files.com/60807ca2d01082168c9aac03/60a9d93e492f9d6ace30ed7c_video-games-and-depression-1024x684.jpeg"/>
<p>Social disconnection is a real problem in the gaming community. Out of all the negative effects of video games, this one is 
    touted a lot. Though we play multiplayer games, we rarely end up connecting with the people in our games. Some communities are 
    more conducive to authentic human interaction than others. However, those are the exception. Isolation can be extremely detrimental 
    to your mental health. Evolution did not design human beings to be solitary creatures. We thrive in groups where can we can support 
    each other.

An Iranian study done on second-grade students in 2009 found that individuals who were addicted to video games tended to have lower 
social skills than those who were not. Social interaction is a skill, and if you spend most of your time alone in your room, playing 
games, and not interacting with other people in real life, then that skill will deteriorate. That can lead to social anxiety, which
 makes the problem worse.

</p>

<h5 className="subhed">
Toxic Environments</h5>
<img className="imgg" src="https://assets.website-files.com/60807ca2d01082168c9aac03/60a9d93ed93f7dc5ac58440c_Burning-Environment-1024x683.jpeg"/>
<p>In our society, men are culturally only allowed to express one negative emotion: anger. If they express other negative emotions, such as shame or fear, they are seen as weak or overly sensitive. 
    That makes men more susceptible to developing alexithymia, especially if they are addicted to video games.

Statistics on the gender breakdown on the internet say that it consists of about 54% males and 46% females, as of 2019. However, some 
spaces such as Twitch are male-dominated. That is a lot of people in the gaming community who might feel that anger is the only 
acceptable emotion they can express. Hence, it is no surprise that these communities are so toxic.

Some gaming communities are more toxic than others. A potential reason for that could be that some games are more competitive than 
others, and competition sometimes does not bring out the best in us.</p>

<h5 className="subhed">Academic Performance</h5>
<img className="imgg" src="https://assets.website-files.com/60807ca2d01082168c9aac03/60a9d93eb72ec30874c5888f_Failure-1024x538.jpeg"/>
<p>If you are addicted to gaming, then your academic and professional success is likely to suffer. People who play games excessively 
    find it challenging to pay attention to their jobs or school. It is quite common to turn to video games when your performance in 
    these areas suffers. Games turn into an escape when the responsibilities in your life feel overwhelming.

A cross-sectional and longitudinal study of adolescents in secondary school showed a negative association of screen time with school 
achievement one year later, independent of their physical activity, age, gender, and socio-economic status. It suggests a link between 
increased gaming and poor academic performance.

You can have a healthy gaming habit and still maintain excellent performance at school or work. But due to the way games affect 
your brain, it is much easier to lose yourself in the virtual world then to try to tackle hardships in the real world. For example, many children and teenagers start gaming because they find a community that does not judge them for their socio-economic background or physical appearance. They get attached to this community and start
 to become disinterested in their performance in school, which leads to their grades taking a hit.</p>

<h5 className="subhed">Escapism and Being Stuck in Life</h5>
<img className="imgg" src="https://scandasia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Playing-games.jpg"/>
<p>We know that video games provide a safe space for people to escape to when they do not feel equipped to deal with the problems

    in their life. However, sometimes this can become problematic. If video games prevent you from finding ways to deal with your issues, then that is an issue.

If you spend 10 hours a day playing video games, then there is a chance that you are not facing the problems in your life head-on. While it can be quite painful to do so, it is also one of the best ways to move forward. You don’t have to quit video games. You can maintain a healthy balance by taking one step at a time to take back
 control of your life.</p>

<h5 className="subhed">Conclusion</h5>

<p>As you might have noticed, most of the negative effects of video games arise from excessive use. Even the health issues mentioned 
    only become a problem when a person spends hours in one place playing video games.

While it may seem like video games can create a lot of problems, there are plenty of gamers that lead successful lives and still play 
video games. Moderate doses of gaming make all the difference between playing games 
for enjoyment and gaming controlling your life. If you can address the underlying issues that make you want to play video games for 10+ 
hours a day, you can take back control of your life.
